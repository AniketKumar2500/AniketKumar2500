### My Story
In 2019 November when i was in class 4th, my father who is a big mind brought a teacher to teach me C from here i started my journey to be a programmer. But when COVID-19 came my school has closed and from this moment i started creating projects in C & C++ then learned HTML & CSS to make webpages using these techniques i made some projects, then a new thing came in my life that is Python which boosted my journey using this i learned Data Analysis, Web frameworks using these i made a search engine. On 19 march i started making a programming language firstly using Python then i switched to C/C++ for this and made Csq programming language and simultaneously started learning ML these two things are still in progress.<br>
from here i could conclude that the biggest person behind my journey is my dear father "Dr. Amit Kumar Verma" who is a professor in an university.
